 * Exception to deal with problems that can occur during metrics calculation.
 * <p>
 * If this exception is thrown, it is always due to a bug in the metric
 * definition file (typos, a required attribute is missing, an unknown metric is
 * requested etc.) The only way to fix the problem is then to edit the metric
 * definition file.
 * <p>
 * For a correct metric definition file, this exception will never be thrown. So
 * unless users write their own metric definitions (and invariably make mistakes
 * in the process), they should never experience any such errors during
 * calculation.
