/**
 * Enumerates the locators for metrics, rules, and so forth in descriptions in
 * the metric definition files.
 * <p>
 * Locators are used to cross-reference metrics, rules, matrices, literature
 * references and glossary items in the documentation of these items. Because of
 * their hyperlink character, locators are constructed like URLs. The string
 * "metric://class/NumOps/" for example references the design metric "NumOps"
 * for elements of type "class".
 * <p>
 * We call the "metric://" part of the locator its prefix (rather than protocol
 * as there is no communication protocol implied). The "class/NumOps/" part are
 * the parameters of the locator. Each locator has a fixed number of parameters.
